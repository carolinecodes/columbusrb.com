        p Columbus Ruby Brigade is looking for a new host beginning with our March 2020 meeting.

        p For four years, CoverMyMeds has been a great host and sponsor of Columbus Ruby Brigade, and we are incredibly grateful for their generosity. Sadly, CoverMyMeds is no longer able to accommodate our schedule, and weâ€™ve jointly agreed that the best course of action is for Columbus Ruby Brigade to seek a new host.

        p A prospective host should be able to seat between 20-50 people (including parking), have a display for presentations, and are friendly to food/drinks. Additional amenities are always appreciated, and rental of this space may constitute an in-kind donation.

        p We value consistency in our location, so prospective hosts should be able to accomodate us on the third Monday of every month through 2020 and beyond.

        p
         | If your company or event space is interested in hosting, please send us an email at&nbsp;
         a href="mailto: hosting@columbusrb.com" style="color: blue;" hosting@columbusrb.com.

        p Thanks again to CoverMyMeds for four years of amazing partnership, and we look forward to starting a new adventure in 2020!

        p Signed,

        p Jon Canady, President of Columbus Ruby Brigade Inc, on behalf of the Board of Directors
